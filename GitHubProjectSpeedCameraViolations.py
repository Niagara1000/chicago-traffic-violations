# In[14]:

# Let's find out how many times a certain number of violations occurred 
# 
# >example: how many instances occurred where there was only 1 violation on any given day?
# 
# First, let's list the frequencies of all numbers of daily violations and analyze what we see.

# In[15]:


v_counts = pd.DataFrame(df.groupby(df['VIOLATIONS']).size())
v_counts.head()


# Let's also rename column `0` to `FREQUENCY`

# In[16]:


v_counts.rename(columns={0:'FREQUENCY'}).head()


# In[18]:


v_counts.rename(columns={0:'FREQUENCY'}).tail()


# ### **Interpretations:**
# 
# - There were 8715 instances when a camera caught just 1 violation in a day.
# - There were 2 instances when a camera caught **479** violations in a day!
# 
# 
# #### Let's further analyze those 2 instances.
# 
# 

# In[19]:


df[df.VIOLATIONS == 479]


# - **We found the corresponding camera. Its ID is CHI149. Both instances were during the Summer of 2015 at 4909 N Cicero Ave.**
# 
#     1. One possible conclusion is that this neighborhood is definitely unsafe for children since there were abnormally high number of violations in just 1 day. 
#         - One might assume that drivers tend to drive poorly in this area, and that is a serious concern. 
#         - It is possible that there is a sudden bump on the road that causes drivers to drive poorly, making them take unsafe turns or stops.
#         - Another possible reason is that there might be frequent spills of oil or other liquids on the road due to some activity either from a home on the street or a nearby factory. This could be causing drivers to lose control over their steering and thus, drive poorly.
#         - The traffic lights may not be working well. It might be the case that the lights are not bright enough for those with poorer vision and drivers might have a hard time telling the difference between green, yellow, and red.
#         - There are many possible reasons for the high number of violations here. It is important to look into the road construction, traffic lights, and surrounding activities to determine what is correlated with the high number of violations.
#         
# **However, it is also important to note that these 2 instances are from only 2 days out of all dates including in the dataset.** Therefore, it is better to plot the number of violations caught by each camera, and identify the potential outliers, and decide whether to keep them in our analysis or discard them. Outliers can serve or disrupt our analysis. It is essential to make good decisions about outliers to avoid false conclusions.
# 
# > Sidenote: Another way to filter the rows with the maximum number of accidents is to use the following code: `df[df.VIOLATIONS == max(df.VIOLATIONS)]`

# ---

# ### OVERALL AVERAGE VIOLATIONS OF EACH CAMERA

# In[20]:


v_avg_per_day = df.groupby(['CAMERA_ID', 'ADDRESS']).mean().sort_values(by='VIOLATIONS', ascending=False)
v_avg_per_day.head()


# `VIOLATIONS` does not state whether the frequency is "per day" or "per month" or "per year". Let's rename the column to make it clear.

# In[21]:


v_avg_per_day.rename(columns={'VIOLATIONS':'AVERAGE VIOLATIONS RECORDED PER DAY'})


# - The resulting table suggests that CHI149 caught more violations per day than other cameras had.
# - However, this could have also been the case due to the abnormally high number of violations on 2 days which increased the camera's overall average number of violations caught.

# 
# <br>
# 
# Let's order the rows in descending order of the `VIOLATIONS`.

# In[17]:


numberOfDaysOfViolations = pd.DataFrame(df.groupby(['VIOLATIONS', 'CAMERA_ID']).size().sort_index(ascending=False))[0:147].rename(columns={0:'Count of Days on which `CAMERA_ID` caught `VIOLATIONS` number of violations'})
numberOfDaysOfViolations.head()


# We can see that camera CHI149 caught 479 violations on 2 days.

# ---
# 
# <br><br>

# Let's further analyze the violations caught by camera CHI149.

# In[17]:


df[df['CAMERA_ID']=='CHI149']


# In[187]:


df[df['CAMERA_ID']=='CHI149']['VIOLATIONS'].sum()


# Total number of violations caught by CHI149 = 296,755

# In[188]:


df[['CAMERA_ID','VIOLATIONS']]['VIOLATIONS'].sum()


# Total number of violations caught by all cameras = 4,924,723 

# ### Interpretation: 
# 
# - Camera CHI149 caught 296,755 violations out of all the 4,924,723 violations in total over the years.
# - CHI149 caught (296755/4924723*100)% of all violations = 6.026% of all violations.
# 

# Even though CHI149 caught so many violations in 2 days, it only recorded 6.026% of all the violations.
# 
# Let's analyze what other cameras caught large number of violations to better understand what is going on.

# ---

# ---

# But first, let's analyze CHI149 violation patterns over time

# In[189]:


chi149 = df[df['CAMERA_ID']=='CHI149'].sort_values('V_DATE')


# In[190]:


chi149.head()


# In[191]:


chi149.count() # chi149 contains 1506 rows


# In[192]:


chi149Dates = chi149[['V_DATE', 'VIOLATIONS']]
chi149Dates.sort_values(by=['V_DATE'])


# - The dates are not in order. 
# - We will fix this error by splitting the dates in the original dataframe, `df`, into month, day, and year, and then order the dates based on year, and then month, and finally, day.

# In[193]:


# Already imported datetime as datetime 
# to extract months, dates, and years of dates 
# in order to find the earliest & latest date available.

# creating new columns
df['month'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['V_DATE']).month
df['date'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['V_DATE']).day
df['year'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['V_DATE']).year

sortedDates = df.sort_values(['year', 'month', 'date'])
sortedDates


# **Important Note:** We could have used `df.sort_values('V_DATE')` but it gives the wrong order of dates. The corresponding output will say 01/01/2015 is the earliest (it is the first row of the output), 
# and 12/31/2017 is the latest. The reason is that the automatic sorting order is month, date, and then year. However, we need the dates ordered by year, month, and finally, date. 
# 
# We can do so using the following code:
# 
# > `df.sort_values(['year', 'month', 'date'])` 
# 
# as we did above.
# 
# After ordering the dates correctly, we can see that the earliest date of the whole dataset is 07/01/2014 and the latest is 12/23/2018.
# 
# <br>
# 
# 

# <br>
# Let's consider only the rows related to CHI149 again.

# In[194]:


chi149 = sortedDates[sortedDates['CAMERA_ID']=='CHI149'] # since already sorted, do not require `.sort_values(by=['year', 'month', 'date'])`
chi149


# #### We can see that 11/01/2014 is the earliest and 12/23/2018 is the latest recorded date for CHI149.
# 
# <br><br>
# 
# Now that we have ordered all the rows of chi149, let's plot the dates and number of violations. There are a total of 1506 rows, so the resulting plot will be messy since each date appears only once in this subset of data, and there are many dates to be displayed on the x-axis. So, the x-axis is very hard to read.
